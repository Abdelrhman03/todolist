### file app ###

in this file there are the files that manage database , and Core folder that mange route and direct
browser to page and Controllers folder in this folder to display web page we have html and php file 
html mange ui and php call data or send or recive data to make the order the file in goood way we need to 
seprate every part, to can detect error, in controll files will manage the php part of web page 

index.php this file manage all project file and make connection between them and call every file in right time 


composer.json file
//we need to link files togther to use require and write the place and name of the files we need
//composer can do this for us we need to write this code
// "autoload": {
          "classmap": [
              "app/"
          ],
          "files": [
              "app/helpers.php"
          ]
  how the code above work in fact this classmap mean link this class togther, and files mean this files contain no class
  so don't add it like all other files

  after write this code
  we will type in terminal "dump-autoload" and we will find files in vendor/composer/we will find autoload_files where
  the composer make the process of linking file togther automaticaly
  you can look at autoload_classmap.php file you will know how it acctualy work and that will be useful
